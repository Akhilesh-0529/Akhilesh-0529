## 🚀 About Me

I'm a passionate learner and aspiring **AI & Automation Developer** from India, currently exploring ways to use technology to make tasks smarter and life easier.

I’ve built automation projects from beginner to advanced level — combining tools like Python, Google Apps Script, AI APIs (like Gemini/GPT), and low-code platforms like Zapier and Make.

Even though I started without strong coding skills, I’ve grown by building real-world projects and learning every day.
